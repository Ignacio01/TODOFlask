<h1>TODOFlask app</h1> 
<p>This REST API, designed with FLASK, allows to create, update, retrieve and delete tasks to be done.</p>

<p>The database used for this API is PostgreSQL. However, you could use any other database by changing the database URI, in the config file.<p>

<p>To test the API, if you are looking for a software and do not want to use CURL, I recommend to use Postman.</p>
